This package is meant to hold Gazebo files for the robot simulation and any scripts needed for initializing that simulation. To create a new Gazebo file, modify gazebo/grid.txt, which represents the grid of walls in the final simulation. "0" represents empty space while any other character represents a solid wall.

Simulation is now handled by the full.sh script (not in this repo).
